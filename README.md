# JBot
 A simple Discord bot I made using Discord.js then re-wrote in golang DiscordGo

### Dependencies
- "github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo"
- "github.com/google/uuid"

### Purpose
This was orginially a project to teach me NodeJS, and have some fun in my discord server. But then while procrastinating doing coursework I re-wrote it in Golang


### Features
- Keeps track of how many times each user says the word "nice"
- Replies "General Kenobi" to the message "Hello There"
- Reacts with a ðŸ¤® when a user's message contains the word "uwu"
- List "nice" scores
- Run "neofetch" to see the specs of the server
- Run "fortune" to see the result of the fortune program
