# JBot
 A simple Discord bot I made using Discord.js

### Dependencies
- node.js
- Discord.js  

### Purpose

I made this Discord bot purely for fun. I have it running on a very old Intel Atom PC at my house. I have put the code online in case anyone has any suggestions, or wants a base for a similar project.

### Features I want to implement

- Vote to kick
- List "nice" scores
- Roles based on participation
- add an update feature (Can run a command and it will get itself from GitHub)
- A poll system based on reactions
- Kick user using username
